# TMDB Predict - R Collab

## Data loading and cleaning

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv("train.csv")
print(data)
```

We load our initial data as a tibble, and start inspecting it. As a tibble, we can safely load it and it just gives us the first ten rows with color-coded information on column types.
